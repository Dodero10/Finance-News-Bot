# Project Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Finance News Bot project, including timelines, major milestones, and deliverables.

## Project Timeline

The project will be implemented over a period of 12 weeks, divided into four major phases:

### Phase 1: Research and Design (Weeks 1-2)

- **Week 1:** Research existing financial news aggregators and crawlers
- **Week 2:** Design system architecture and component specifications

### Phase 2: Web Crawler Development (Weeks 3-5)

- **Week 3:** Develop basic crawler functionality for TinNhanhChungKhoan
- **Week 4:** Implement data extraction and storage mechanisms
- **Week 5:** Add error handling, rate limiting, and resilience features

### Phase 3: Data Processing and Analysis (Weeks 6-9)

- **Week 6:** Develop text preprocessing pipeline
- **Week 7:** Implement basic NLP features (keyword extraction, categorization)
- **Week 8:** Add sentiment analysis and trend detection
- **Week 9:** Develop data visualization components

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Weeks 10-12)

- **Week 10:** Integrate all components into a unified system
- **Week 11:** Perform comprehensive testing and debugging
- **Week 12:** Finalize documentation and prepare for deployment

## Key Deliverables

1. **Web Crawler Module**
   - Python-based crawler for TinNhanhChungKhoan
   - Data extraction and cleaning utilities
   - Storage mechanisms for collected articles

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Text preprocessing components
   - Article categorization system
   - Sentiment analysis module
   - Trend detection algorithms

3. **User Interface**
   - Basic web interface for viewing processed news
   - Visualization tools for trends and insights
   - Search and filtering capabilities

4. **Documentation**
   - Technical documentation for all components
   - User guide for interacting with the system
   - Development history and progress reports

## Resource Requirements

- **Development Tools:**
  - Python 3.8+
  - Selenium and ChromeDriver
  - BeautifulSoup and related libraries
  - NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy, etc.)
  - Database system (SQLite for development, potentially PostgreSQL for production)

- **Infrastructure:**
  - Development environment (local machines)
  - Version control system (Git)
  - Potential cloud hosting for the final product

## Risk Management

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Website structure changes | Medium | High | Implement modular scrapers with easy update paths |
| Rate limiting/blocking | High | High | Use rotating proxies, respect robots.txt, implement delays |
| Data quality issues | Medium | Medium | Build robust validation and cleaning pipelines |
| Scope creep | Medium | Medium | Clear requirements definition, regular progress reviews |

## Evaluation Criteria

The success of the project will be evaluated based on:

1. Reliability of the crawler (percentage of successful article extractions)
2. Quality of processed data (accuracy of categorization and sentiment analysis)
3. System performance (speed and resource utilization)
4. User experience (ease of access to information)
