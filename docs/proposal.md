# Project Proposal

## Problem Statement

Financial markets generate a vast amount of news and information daily. Investors, analysts, and financial professionals need to stay updated with the latest developments, but manually tracking and analyzing this information is time-consuming and challenging. There's a need for an automated system that can gather, process, and present relevant financial news efficiently.

## Project Objectives

1. **Develop an automated crawler** that can extract financial news articles from Vietnamese financial news websites, starting with [TinNhanhChungKhoan](https://www.tinnhanhchungkhoan.vn).

2. **Create a preprocessing pipeline** to clean, structure, and organize the extracted content, making it suitable for analysis.

3. **Implement analysis algorithms** to identify key information, trends, and insights from the collected news.

4. **Design a user interface** for presenting the processed information in an accessible and intuitive manner.

## Expected Outcomes

- A reliable web crawler that can regularly fetch financial news articles
- A structured database of processed financial news
- Analytical insights derived from the collected data
- A user-friendly interface for accessing the information

## Significance

This project will:

- Reduce the time and effort required to stay updated with financial news
- Help identify important market trends and events quickly
- Provide a foundation for further research and development in financial data analysis
- Potentially aid in financial decision-making by highlighting relevant information

## Technical Approach

The project will primarily use Python as the development language, leveraging libraries such as Selenium and BeautifulSoup for web scraping. Data will be processed using natural language processing techniques, and the resulting information will be stored in appropriate data structures for efficient retrieval and analysis.

## Feasibility

The project is feasible within the given timeframe and with the available resources. It builds upon established web scraping and data analysis techniques while applying them to a specific domain (financial news). The modular approach allows for incremental development and testing of each component.
